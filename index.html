               <p>When I first heard about The Hidden Genuis Project, I thought it would be boring & I didn't want to do it.
                  When my grandmother told me about it, it seemed as if I would do more work outside of school. At Interview Day, I met the other geniuses.
                  I didn't think I'd like them because they were a little loud & a bit annoying.
                  Since being in the program, I've gotten to know them & we're all pretty cool. When I discovered The Hidden Genius Project would out give us food, money & a MacBook, I was hyped!
                  The work has been pretty easy since I began understanding it.</p>

                  My favorite  Anime is "Naruto" because of its animaton.
                  Naruto has some of the best fights like rock lee vs gaara.
                  I don't like how the show has so many filler episodes, but they have good storylines, but most of the side characters be dyeing.
                  In my opinion naruto has good character development.
